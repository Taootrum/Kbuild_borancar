# Kbuild

This is an attempt to carve out Kbuild out of the Linux kernel tree and allow
it to be used as a general-purpose build system for embedded projects. Projects
like BusyBox and Buildroot already use KBuild but they use an older version.

## License

The Linux kernel is licenses under GPLv2 (see COPYING) and this is carved out
from the tree so I am not quite sure about the license yet. In any case,
I am quite happy with whatever example code I have added here to be under the
same license as Kbuild.
